# Installation
Just merge src and applications directories to $FOAM_INST_DIR/foam-extend-4.0 and then
rebuild fe40.

# Tutorials
* puyo  
Tutorial of Honda's concept car puyo solved by Steady PISO solver with VONOS  
and WACEB schemes and SA-RC-neg turbulence model with modified Stilda. Mesh  
was generated by snappyHexMesh of OpenFOAM v1706 in order to satisfy the
mesh quality required for high-accuracy schemes.
